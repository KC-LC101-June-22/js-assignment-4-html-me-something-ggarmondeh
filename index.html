        <p>
            I was born in Liberia, a small country on the western coast of Africa, in its capital city of Monrovia. 
            I went to elementary school, middle school, and kindergarten in Liberia.
            My father brought my family and I to the United States when I was twelve years old so we could leave Liberia's civil war behind.
            He wished for us to uphold the American dream and have improved health and education.

            From 2010 through 2014, I attended Health and Science High School in Beaverton, Oregon.
            Since Health and Science didn't have a sports program, 
            I participated in basketball, track, and cross country for Aloha High School in high school.
